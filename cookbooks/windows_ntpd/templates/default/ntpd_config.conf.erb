# NTP Network Time Protocol 
# **** ATTENTION ****: *You have to restart the NTP service when you change this file to activate the changes* 
# PLEASE CHECK THIS FILE CAREFULLY AND MODIFY IT IF REQUIRED 
# please check http://www.ntp.org for additional documentation and background information
# Use drift file 
driftfile "<%= @ntp_install_dir %>\etc\ntp.drift"

# your local system clock, could be used as a backup
# (this is only useful if you need to distribute time no matter how good or bad it is)
#server 127.127.1.0
# but it should operate at a high stratum level to let the clients know and force them to
# use any other timesource they may have.
#fudge 127.127.1.0 stratum 12

# Use a NTP server from the ntp pool project (see http://www.pool.ntp.org)
# Please note that you need at least four different servers to be at least protected against
# one falseticker. If you only rely on internet time, it is highly recommended to add
# additional servers here. 
# The 'iburst' keyword speeds up initial synchronization, please check the documentation for more details!
